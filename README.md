Core, helper, and future functions for bioinformatics packages: [`GSEA.jl`](https://github.com/KwatMDPhD/GSEA.jl), [`MolecularMedicine.jl`](https://github.com/KwatMDPhD/MolecularMedicine.jl), `Immunogram.jl`, `TCRgram.jl`, `BioMap.jl`, `BioMatch.jl`, and `Chopper.jl`. (Unlinked ones are private and or owned by somebody else.)

Parts of this package may grow into their own packages, like `Kumo.jl`.

This package used to be called `BioLab.jl`.
When registering this package, however, [community feedback](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/pull/72714#issuecomment-1329916791) encouraged name change to not be `Core` and reflect growing bioinformatics functionalities, with an aim to grow into a bioinformatics ecosystem.
